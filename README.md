# Generating Generators

Finding which polyomials are irreducible in a polynomial ring generally requires individual checking. Once a quotient ring is formed
with one of these irreducible polynomials, it can be hard to find generators since this also requires individual checking. I've written
here some functionality to find irreducible polynomials in polynomial rings and the order of different elements within different polynomial
quotient rings. More info in the notebook
